<h2>Contact Information</h2>
<p><a href="mailto:info@pickagame.com.ng">info@pickagame.com.ng</a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>(“pickagame” or “we”), collects personal data of its customers, users and visitors whilst providing its pickagame-service, websites and possible other services (jointly hereinafter “Services”). The pickagame-service (hereinafter “Pickagame”) is a service provided for the purposes of connecting friends in order to create fun, and share gifts and earn extra cash along side. To use pickagame, you are required to register to pickagame by providing your real name or alias, and your email address. Some functions and sub-services of the Services may require more information to be provided, but this will be clearly stated and you will be requested to provide the extra information before you can use these certain services and functions.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy governs the principles of storing and processing the personal data included in the Register. This Privacy Policy explains what data we process, how we do that and how you may use your rights as a data subject (e.g. right to object, right of access).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time to if required in order to reflect the changes in data processing practices or otherwise. You can find the current version on our website (<a href="index.html">pickagame.com.ng</a>).</p>
<p>The Privacy Policy does not address and we are not responsible for, the privacy practices of any third parties.</p>
<h2>Purpose for processing personal data</h2>
<p>There are several purposes for the processing of your personal data by pickagame:</p>
<p><em>To provide our Services</em></p>
<p>pickagame processes your personal data in the first place to be able to deliver our Services to you. We would like to know who you are, so we can tailor our service to meet your needs and desires as precisely as possible. Some of the functions of our Services are simply unable to work properly if we do not know who is using them. If you contact our customer service, we will use the information provided by you to answer your questions or solve your complaint. In order to ensure that our Services are in line with your needs, these data can be used for things like customer satisfaction surveys. We might also request another party to do this for us.</p>
<p><em>For customer communication (including marketing)</em></p>
<p>pickagame processes your personal data to contact you regarding our Services and to inform you of changes to our Services. Your data is also used for research and analysis to improve our Services. We may also use your data entered on our Services in certain cases to send information and marketing communication by e-mail, provided that you have given us consent to that or other legitimate grounds for such marketing communication exists.</p>
<p><em>Legitimate grounds for processing and storage limitation</em></p>
<p>pickagame processes your personal data to perform our contractual obligations towards you and to comply with legal obligations. Furthermore, we process your personal data to pursue our legitimate interest to maintain and develop our businesses.</p>
<p>We store personal data only as long as necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. Once the data is no longer necessary, we delete or anonymize it as soon as possible.</p>
<h2>Processed Data and Sources of Data</h2>
<p>Pickagame collects two types of information from our customers and users of the Services: (i) Customer Data; and (ii) Technical Data. Although we do not normally use Technical Data to identify you as an individual, you can sometimes be recognized from it. In such situations, Technical Data can also be considered personal data under applicable laws.</p>
<p>We may collect the following basic Customer Data and store it in the Register: (i) first and last name; (ii) e-mail address, telephone number (iii) transactional data. In addition, we may collect the following data arising from the customer relationship (i) information relating to maintaining the customer relationship; (ii) information on marketing permissions; and (iii) customer service data.</p>
<p>We may collect Customer Data from our customers and visitors in a variety of ways, including, when they register to our Services, when they submit customer feedback, claims or other communication or when they subscribe to a newsletter or fill out a form. Further, please note that we also collect details of any transactions and payments you carry out through our service. We will collect Customer Data from customers and visitors only if they voluntarily submit such information to us or carry out transactions or payments through our Services. We may also update and supplement personal data with information provided by third parties in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p>We and/or our authorized third party service providers, may automatically collect Technical Data when you visit or interact with our Services. Technical Data may include the browser name, the type of computer or device, time spent on website, interaction with the services, URL of the website you visited before and after visiting the website, the time and date of user visits, surfing habits, IP address, operating system and the Internet service providers utilized and other similar technical information.</p>
<p><em>Cookies</em></p>
<p>We use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Shark Punch website, including cookies. Cookies allow us to calculate the aggregate number of people visiting our websites and monitor the use of the websites. This helps us to improve our websites and better serve our users. We also use cookies that make the use of the website easier for you, for example by remembering usernames, passwords and (language) preferences. We also use tracking and analytics cookies to see how well our services are being received by our users.</p>
<p>The service may also contain advertisements served by third parties that deliver cookies or other tracking technologies to your device so your online activities across third-party sites or online services can be tracked for advertising purposes. These third-party services are governed by separate privacy policies.</p>
<p>You may choose to set your web browser to refuse cookies, or to alert you when cookies are being sent. If you do so, note that some parts of our websites may not function properly. For more information about cookies and how to delete them, visit <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<h2>Recipients</h2>
<p>We do not share your personal data with third parties outside unless one of the following circumstances applies:</p>
<p><em>For legal reasons</em></p>
<p>We may share your personal data with third parties if we have a good-faith belief that access to and use of the personal data is reasonably necessary to: (i) meet any applicable law, regulation, and/or court order; (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; and/or (iii) protect the interests, properties or safety of pickagame, our users or the public as far as in accordance with the law. When possible, we will inform you about such processing.</p>
<p><em>For other legitimate reasons</em></p>
<p>If pickagame is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, we may transfer your personal data to the third party involved. However, we will continue to ensure the confidentiality of all personal data. We will give notice to all customers concerned before the personal data is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<p><em>With your explicit consent</em></p>
<p>We may share your personal data with third parties outside pickagame for other reasons than the ones mentioned before, when we have your explicit consent to do so. You have the right to withdraw this consent at all times.</p>
<h2>Your Rights</h2>

<p><em>Right to object</em></p>
<p>You may object to certain use of your personal data if such data are processed for other purposes than necessary for the performance of our Services or for compliance with a legal obligation. You may also object any further processing of your personal data after prior given consent. If you object to the further processing of your personal data, this may lead to fewer possibilities to use our Services.</p>

<p>You have the right to receive your personal data from us in a structured, commonly used format in order to transmit the data to another controller.</p>
<p><em>How to use your rights</em></p>
<p>You may use these rights by sending a letter or e-mail, including your name, address, phone number and a copy of a valid ID to us on the addresses set out above. If your request regards personal data in a cookie, you have to enclose a copy of the said cookie. We may request the provision of additional information necessary to confirm your identity.

<p>We will take all reasonable, appropriate security measures to protect pickagame and our customers from unauthorised access to or unauthorised alteration, disclosure or destruction of personal data we hold. Measures include, where appropriate, encryption, firewalls, secure facilities and access rights systems. Should despite of the security measures, a security breach occur that is likely to have negative effects to your privacy, we will inform you about the breach as soon as reasonably possible.</p>
